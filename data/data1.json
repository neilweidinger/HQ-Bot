Of the few specializations of the reptilian digestive system, the evolution of one pair of salivary glands into poison glands in the venomous snakes is the most remarkable.  During development the embryos of higher vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals) consecutively develop three separate sets of kidneys; these are arranged in longitudinal sequence in the body cavity. The first set, the pronephroi, are vestigial",
